# Letter B Printer

This Java program prints the letter "B" on the console using asterisks (`*`). The letter is generated using a 2D array.

## Program Description

The program does the following:

1. **Creates a 2D array** with dimensions 8x4.
2. **Fills the array** with asterisks and spaces to form the letter "B".
3. **Prints the array** to the console to display the letter.

## How It Works

1. **Array Initialization:** The program initializes an 8x4 2D array to represent the letter "B".
2. **Looping and Filling:**
   - The first, fourth, and last rows are filled with asterisks (`*`).
   - The first and last columns are also filled with asterisks.
   - All other positions are filled with spaces to shape the "B" letter.
3. **Output:** The filled array is then printed row by row to the console.
